# Malware Detection Simulation with Sophos

### Objective:
Trigger a safe malware detection event using the EICAR test file and document Sophosâ€™s detection, response, and reporting capabilities.

---

### Tools Used:
- Sophos Intercept X
- EICAR test file
- Sophos Central Dashboard

---

### What I Did:

- Deployed the EICAR test file on a test endpoint to safely simulate malware behavior  
- Observed and documented Sophosâ€™s real-time detection and automated response  
- Verified that alerts were immediately generated in the Sophos Central dashboard  
- Reviewed the threat timeline and investigated details such as file path, process, and hostname  
- Confirmed endpoint remediation actions including quarantine and alert escalation  

---

### Outcome:

- Validated endpoint protection capabilities in a safe environment  
- Demonstrated Sophosâ€™s rapid threat detection, auto-remediation, and alerting workflow  
- Helped assess response timing and visibility for simulated malware threats
