### Objective:
Review suspicious activity, detect and investigate the event in QRadar, and document the detection, investigation, and response workflow.

---

### Tools Used:
- IBM QRadar
- Offense Viewer
- Log Activity

---

### What I Did:

- Identified and reviewed suspicious login behavior within the QRadar offense dashboard  
- Drilled into correlated offenses to analyze log data, source/destination IPs, and event types  
- Used QRadar’s “Log Activity” view to trace authentication anomalies and brute-force indicators   
- Documented the entire detection → investigation → response workflow, including potential improvements  

---

### Outcome:

- Demonstrated real-time event correlation and log analysis capabilities in QRadar  
- Gained experience with triaging offenses and tracing abnormal activity through logs  
- Strengthened understanding of incident response workflows and SIEM tuning practices
