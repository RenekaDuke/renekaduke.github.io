# Ethical Phishing Campaign Simulation

### Objective:
Design and deploy a controlled phishing email in a lab or test environment to better understand attacker techniques and evaluate security defenses.

---

### Tools Used:
- Sophos Phish Threat
- Internal user group (intern cohort)
- Training modules & campaign tracking dashboard

---

### What I Did:

- Created and launched a targeted phishing simulation using **Sophos Phish Threat**  
- Designed the phishing email to mimic real-world tactics, testing awareness and response  
- Targeted fellow interns as the recipient group, simulating an internal threat exposure scenario  
- Enabled automatic enrollment in a security awareness training module for anyone caught by the simulation  
- Monitored campaign metrics including:
  - Who opened the email  
  - Who clicked the phishing link  
  - Who reported it  
  - Who completed (or ignored) the training module  

---

### Outcome:

- Gained hands-on experience designing and executing a phishing campaign from end to end  
- Reinforced the importance of user awareness and education in a layered security strategy  
- Provided insights into user behavior and helped promote better cyber hygiene within the intern group  
- Strengthened skills in reporting, metrics interpretation, and phishing simulation best practices
