# Blocking IOC Domains and IPs Across Security Platforms

### Objective:
Mitigate threats by blocking known malicious domains and IP addresses across multiple security platforms, ensuring protection across the corporate and distribution center data centers.

---

### Tools Used:
- Sophos Central (Email Security, Web Protection)
- Palo Alto Panorama (Firewall Policies)

---

### What I Did:

- Acted as an administrator in both **Sophos Central** and **Panorama (Palo Alto)**  
- Blocked known malicious domains and IP addresses in both platforms to mitigate potential threat exposure

#### In Sophos Central:
- Blocked malicious URLs in **email security** for both inbound and outbound email traffic  
- Blocked malicious websites in **website management** to prevent access via outbound web traffic  

#### In Palo Alto Panorama:
- Created and applied security policy rules to block IOC traffic at the firewall level for both the **corporate data center** and **distribution center**  
- Deployed and pushed configuration changes across both environments  
- Submitted a ticket to extend these protections to the **third data center**

---

### Outcome:

Malicious Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) were successfully blocked across all primary security platforms, enhancing the organization's defense posture and reducing exposure to external threats.
