# Reneka Duke — IT Security Internship Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases a collection of cybersecurity and IT security projects I completed during my internship. Each project highlights hands-on experience with industry tools, real-world challenges, and practical solutions.

**What you’ll find here:**
- Vulnerability scanning and reporting  
- Threat detection and incident investigation  
- Endpoint protection and patch management  
- Security automation and scripting  
- Phishing simulations and threat hunting  
- Risk assessments and governance recommendations  

I am passionate about learning, problem-solving, and applying technology to secure enterprise environments. Thank you for reviewing my work!

## Projects

### [1. Vulnerability Scan & Report using Tenable.io](projects/project1-tenable.md)  
**Objective:** Conduct a credentialed scan in Tenable.io and report on medium to low severity vulnerabilities with actionable remediation plans.

### [2. SIEM Threat Detection using QRadar](projects/project2-qradar.md)  
**Objective:** Review suspicious activity, detect and investigate the event in QRadar, and document the detection, investigation, and response workflow.

### [3. Malware Detection Simulation with Sophos](projects/project3-sophos.md)  
**Objective:** Trigger a safe malware event using the EICAR test file and document Sophos’s detection and response.

### [4. Targeted Patch Deployment via BigFix](projects/project4-bigfix.md)  
**Objective:** Deploy a required software update to a designated endpoint and confirm successful installation to maintain patch compliance.

### [5. CAB Pre-Implementation Report using Gytpol](projects/project5-gytpol.md)  
**Objective:** Run a Gytpol scan to identify endpoint misconfigurations prior to a change implementation and document a pre-CAB report addressing potential risks.

### [6. Blocking IOC Domains and IPs Across Security Platforms](projects/project6-ioc-blocking.md)  
**Objective:** Mitigate threats by blocking known malicious domains and IP addresses across multiple security platforms, including Sophos and Panorama.

### [7. Ethical Phishing Campaign Simulation](projects/project7-ethical-phishing.md)  
**Objective:** Design and deploy a controlled phishing email in a lab or test environment to better understand attacker techniques and evaluate security defenses.

### [8. Phishing Email Analysis and Threat Hunting](projects/project8-phishing-analysis.md)  
**Objective:** Analyze a phishing email using MxToolbox, VirusTotal, Shodan, and Sophos to detect, respond to, and block associated threats across the organization.

### [9. Security Risk Assessment for Microsoft Power Automate](projects/project9-power-automate.md)  
**Objective:** Evaluate the security risks of Microsoft Power Automate and recommend governance solutions using DLP policies and platform controls.

### [10. Automated Threat IOC Replacement and Panorama Firewall Deployment](projects/project10-ioc-automation.md)  
**Objective:** Automate the process of updating outdated threat indicators and deploying them to Panorama firewalls via CLI and SSH.
